# =============================================================================
# DEPRECATED - This configuration file is no longer required
# =============================================================================
#
# The new YARRRML-direct ETL engine processes mapping files directly without
# needing a separate configuration file. All configuration is derived from
# the YARRRML specification:
#
# - Sources: Defined in YARRRML mappings
# - Targets: Defined in YARRRML targets section
# - Prefixes: Defined in YARRRML prefixes section
# - Output: Derived from targets or command line
#
# NEW USAGE:
#   python rdf_star_etl_yarrrml.py <mapping_file.yaml> [output_file.trig]
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   python rdf_star_etl_yarrrml.py mappings/data_products_rml.yaml
#   python rdf_star_etl_yarrrml.py mappings/my_mapping.yaml output/result.trig
#
# The old engine (rdf_star_etl_engine_optimized.py) still works with this
# config file for backward compatibility.
